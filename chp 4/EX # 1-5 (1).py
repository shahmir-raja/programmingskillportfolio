Exercise 1: Alien Colors #1 

Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.

•Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.

•Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)
"""
#Assign the color of the alien
alien_color='green'
#the statement if the alien color is green then print msg
if alien_color=='green':
    print('player just earned 5 points.')
#second version of thes program if that fails with no output    
alien_color='red'    
if alien_color=='green':
    print('player just earned 5 points.')
